#'Prognaus is an individual tree growth model. PrognausBaseSV includes
#'the basal area increment model, the height increment model, the crown ratio
#'model, mortality model and ingrowth model of Prognaus. The basal area increment model
#'is also availabel as diameter increment model to facilitate calculation.

#'In addition functions to calculate the open-grown crown diameter, the crown cover
#'and the form factor or volume of individual trees are provided to
#'facilitate computation. All references are given in
